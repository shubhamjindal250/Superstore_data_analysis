## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation (Power Query)

The original dataset required transformation before analysis. Key steps included:

* Fixing **mixed date formats** (dd/mm/yyyy & mm/dd/yyyy) using a custom Power Query M function.
* Changing incorrect data types (Date, Whole Number, Currency).
* Removing duplicates and null entries.
* Standardizing the schema for reporting.
* Extracting clean fields for time‑intelligence analysis.

## 🧮 DAX Measures Used

Multiple DAX measures were created to support KPIs and detailed analysis, including:

* **Total Sales / Revenue**
* **Total Profit**
* **Profit Margin**
* **Sales by Category, Region, Segment**
* **Highest Profit Category**
* **Top Customers**
* **Discount Impact on Profit**

These calculations enabled deeper insights into sales performance, profitability, and product behavior.

## 📢 Impact & Key Insights (Story of the Dashboard)

This dashboard delivers several strong insights that reveal clear business patterns and opportunities for strategic improvement.

### **1️⃣ Technology Leads as the Profit Engine**

The Technology category stands out as the highest profit generator. This indicates strong demand and healthier margins compared to Furniture and Office Supplies.

### **2️⃣ Sales Are Well Distributed, but Profitability Varies by Region**

The East region drives the highest sales (~30%), while the South and Central regions show moderate performance. However, profits do not always align with sales volume, suggesting regional cost or discounting issues.

### **3️⃣ Discounts Are Directly Hurting Monthly Profitability**

Monthly trends show months with high sales but low or even negative profit. This highlights excessive discounting or high-cost orders during certain periods.

### **4️⃣ Top Customers Contribute a Significant Share**

A small group of customers (Top 10) contribute a noticeable portion of revenue. This concentration suggests an opportunity for loyalty programs or targeted marketing.

### **5️⃣ Seasonal Spikes in Sales Need Better Inventory Planning**

A noticeable spike around months 8–11 suggests predictable seasonal demand. Proper stock planning can reduce stockouts and maximize revenue during these periods.

### **6️⃣ Furniture Shows Strong Revenue but Weaker Margins**

Furniture generates solid sales but does not perform well on the profit side. High shipping costs or heavy discounting may be the reason.

### **Overall Story of the Data**

The business has strong potential with clear category leaders and consistent customer demand. However, profitability is being dragged down by discount-heavy orders and regional inefficiencies. The story the data tells is simple: **optimize discounts, strengthen high-margin categories, improve regional strategies, and leverage high-value customers**.

The project uncovered powerful insights that tell a clear and compelling story about the business. The analysis revealed that while overall sales appear strong, profitability is heavily influenced by discounting strategies. Certain categories—especially those with high demand—generate substantial revenue but lose profit when discounts are applied aggressively. Meanwhile, top-performing categories consistently deliver the highest margins, making them crucial drivers of business growth.

Regional analysis showed that some states outperform others in revenue but struggle with profit margins, highlighting operational inefficiencies or pricing gaps. Time‑series trends exposed seasonal patterns, indicating when demand peaks and where inventory planning can be optimized. Customer analysis identified high‑value customers who contribute disproportionately to profit, guiding targeted retention and loyalty strategies.

These insights collectively show a business with strong potential but uneven performance across categories and regions. The story of the data emphasizes the importance of optimizing discount policies, focusing on high‑margin categories, improving regional operations, and strengthening relationships with the most valuable customers.

## ✔ Conclusion

The Superstore Sales Analysis project showcases how raw sales data can be transformed into meaningful insights using Power BI. The dashboards provide actionable business intelligence and support strategic decision‑making.
